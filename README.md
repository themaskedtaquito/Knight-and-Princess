# Knight-and-Princess
Repo for our Intro to Game Development Final Project

Assets should be shared between all four of us. Once we start getting animations, art, and scripts together, these should all be pushed/pulled to/from the master branch. We'll prototype various stuff in our personal scenes, and at the end we will combine the elements together into a master scene. For better organization, all of our scenes should follow the same naming convention.

Scene Naming Convention:
SectionOfProject_Name.unity
ex. Animation_Mari.unity, LevelOneObstacles_Kim.unity
